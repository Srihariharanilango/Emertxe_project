These are C Programming Projects for Beginners and Engineering Students. C Programming Projects are the testimonials that we have learned a technology well. In Emertxe, it has a hand-picked set of projects, ensuring you apply all your learnings of C programming. These C projects exposed us to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), providing hands-on experience in building real-time industry projects. Explore the list of projects for our Advanced C programming course.

                                                                Address Book

Brief:
Address Book is a small application written in C language. It keeps track of names and telephone/mobile numbers and e-mail addresses. It is a console based application which uses standard I/O for adding and deleting contact names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses, searching names and associated numbers and email addresses, updating numbers and email addresses, and deleting contacts

Pre-requisite:
Function pointers
File I/O handling
Level:
Intermediate

                                                            LSB Image Steganography

Brief:
The art and science of hiding information by embedding messages within other, seemingly harmless messages. Bits of unused data are replaced by bits of valuable information using LSB mechanism. Sender and receiver will have individual key / secret based on which they will be able to extract the actual data from the image. This project also gives basic level understanding of image processing methodologies.

Pre-requisite:
Function pointers
File I/O operations
Bitwise operations

Level:
Intermediate

                                                              Lexical Analyzer

Brief:
Lexical Analyzer is a program which converts the stream of individual characters, normally arranged as lines into the stream of lexical tokens. Tokenization for instance of words and punctuation symbols that make up source code. The main purpose/goal of the project is to take in a C file and produce the sequence of tokens that can be used for the next stage in compilation. This should also take care of necessary error handling conditions that may occur during tokenization.

Pre-requisite:
File I/O operations
File pointers
String operations

Level:
Intermediate
