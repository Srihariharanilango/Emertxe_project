                                                     Car Black Box (CBB) implementation
Brief:
Black Boxes are typically used in any transportation system (ex: Airplanes) that are used for analysis post-crash and understand
the root cause of accidents. Continuous monitoring and logging of events (ex: over-speeding) is critical for effective usage of black box. 
The goal of this project is to implement core functionalities of a care black-box in a PIC based micro-controller supported by rich peripherals.
Events will be logged in EEPROM in this project. This project can be further extended to any vehicle.

Pre-requisite:
PIC micro-controller & schematics
Peripheral (ex: Potentiometer) handling by understanding data-sheets
Interrupt handling

Level:
Intermediate

Brief:
A domestic microwave oven that heats food with precise time and power control,  and event logging. The system is implemented on a PIC microcontroller. The project demonstrates peripheral interfacing, interrupt handling, real‑time control, and reliable non-volatile logging. 
It can be extended with features such as type-based auto-cook.
Pre-requisite:

PIC microcontroller (suggested: PIC16F877A or PIC18F452) and basic schematics

Understanding of peripheral datasheets (keypad, LCD, motor driver, temperature sensors)

Interrupt handling & debouncing techniques


Level:

Intermediate
